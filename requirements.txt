# Requirements for -PET-oonx project
# Tested/known-good ranges are suggestions; adjust to your environment (GPU vs CPU TensorFlow) as needed.

numpy>=1.23.0,<2.0.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0
spectral>=0.23.0          # for spectral.io.envi to read .spe/.hdr

# TensorFlow for training & inference (choose GPU build if you have CUDA configured)
# - For machines with NVIDIA GPU and CUDA installed, install the matching `tensorflow` (or `tensorflow-gpu` for older versions)
# - The project uses Keras APIs and tf2onnx for exporting to ONNX
tensorflow>=2.9.0,<2.14.0
h5py>=3.1.0               # for loading/saving .h5 model weights

# ONNX tooling (optional but recommended if you export/use ONNX models)
tf2onnx>=1.13.0
onnx>=1.12.0
onnxruntime>=1.15.0       # CPU runtime; install onnxruntime-gpu if using GPU execution providers

# Utilities commonly used by the codebase
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
tqdm>=4.60.0
pillow>=9.0.0

# Optional (only if you add extra image processing / I/O)
opencv-python>=4.6.0

# Notes:
# - If you are on Windows and want GPU TensorFlow, follow TensorFlow's official install guide to match CUDA/cuDNN versions.
# - To install quickly in a venv:
#     python -m venv .venv
#     .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1    # PowerShell on Windows
#     pip install -U pip
#     pip install -r requirements.txt
